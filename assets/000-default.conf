#<VirtualHost *:80>
#	# The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
#	# the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
#	# redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
#	# specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
#	# match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
#	# value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
#	# However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
#	#ServerName www.example.com
#
#	ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
#	DocumentRoot /var/www/html
#
#	# Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
#	# error, crit, alert, emerg.
#	# It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular
#	# modules, e.g.
#	#LogLevel info ssl:warn
#
#	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
#	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
#
#	# For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
#	# enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
#	# include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
#	# following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
#	# after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
#	#Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
